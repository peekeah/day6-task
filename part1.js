Part 1: Find the culprits and nail them — debugging javascript

Q) Find the culprit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 <script>
 alert( "I’m JavaScript!'); //here it is ' instead of "
 </script>
 Whats the error in this ?
</body>
</html>

Q) Find the culprit and invoke the alert
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 <script src=”scripts.js”></script> //here is scripts.js instead of script.js
</body>
</html>

Q) Explain the below how it works
alert("I'm JavaScript!");
alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon
alert(`Wor
 ld`)
alert(3 +
1
+ 2); // this is multiple line code and its working
Answer: 1) if semicolon is missing still code will work in javascript,
        2)  (i)  in alert(`Wor
        ld`) 
        template literal is used hence it will run in javascript
            (ii)    in alert(3 +
            1
            + 2);
            all the values are saperated by + hence it will work

Explain Why the Code is blasted and how to diffuse it and get “Diffused”.

answer: "2" > "12"
        here the datatpye of 2 and 12 is string, while comparing as string 12 will be lesser than 2,
        hence code will return Diffused

Q) Whats the msg printed and why? Guess you answer before running it.
var lemein ="0";
var lemeout = 0;
var msg = "";
if (lemein) {
 msg += "hi";
 }
if (lemeout) {
 msg += ‘Hello’;
}
console.log(msg);

answer: it will print hi
        since lemein has datatype as string it will go to if condition,
        and lemeout has data as number 0 it will go to else condition but since there is
        no else part it will skip if part, so over all result will bw hi
